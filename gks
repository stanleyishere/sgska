 <p>I was fortunate enough to receive an award of Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) which I was able to conduct short research program at Chosun University, South Korea.
 I was assigned to <a href="https://www.chosun.ac.kr/user/indexSub.do?codyMenuSeq=25488219&siteId=smart"> CAD/CAM/CAE Lab</a> where I had a wonderful time to work with
 undergraduates from other countries. I also met my <a href="https://stanleyishere.github.io/sgska/projects/quadruped"supervisor</a> as he was doing his PhD threre.
