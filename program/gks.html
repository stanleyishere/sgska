 <p>I was fortunate enough to receive an award of Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) which I was able to conduct short research program at Chosun University, South Korea.
 I was assigned to <a href="https://www.chosun.ac.kr/user/indexSub.do?codyMenuSeq=25488219&siteId=smart">CAD/CAM/CAE Lab</a> where I had a wonderful time to work with
 undergraduates from other countries. I also met my <a href="https://stanleyishere.github.io/sgska/projects/quadruped">supervisor</a> as he was doing his PhD threre.

<p>Our team was assigned to print several dumbbell-shaped specimen with different widths and special designs at the testing section to test the tensile strength of printed specimen.<p>The specimen was modelled using CATIA V5 and printed using Makerbot printers. After that, UTM (could not remember the model) was used to test the specimens.
For more information, please have a look at the <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DADhbVdvetE/I7zx-M17tMiTjjfK5dTCPA/view?utm_content=DADhbVdvetE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton">poster</a>.
<br><br><p>On final day of the program, it was the poster presentation award ceremony. unfortunately, our team came in second place for mechanical engineering category, and thus, we did not receive any award.
Nonetheless, it was still a fruitful experience at Chosun University as I was able to meet many people from different backgrounds.<p>

<p>During my stay at Daegu, I stayed at Kyungpook National University guesthouse and I was able to meet with senior, Chin Ean. She is a PhD student making legged robots too! 
Here are some photos I took at the campus. <p><br>
