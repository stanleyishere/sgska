  <p>This section covers about my robots-making journey during my freshman year and sophomore year for national robotics competition, ROBOCON Malaysia.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #FF7A59;"><b>Past Robots</b></h2>
  I was recruited as the university robotics club member during freshmen year. I started to learn about fundamentals of mechanisms, design theory, and robotics when making robots.
  I realized this was a good opportunity to practize what I've learnt from lecture. From the start, making robot from scratch without any knowledge was definitely difficult, and
  I have to thank my seniors for guiding me along the way.</p><br>
                             
                             
 <p> My first robot was a simple structure that allowed mounting of motors with wheels to execute line following using IR sensors. <em>(Unfortunately, I lost all the photos)</em>
 To prepare for the national competition, I learnt while making robots with seniors.
