  <p>This section covers about my robots-making journey during my freshman year and sophomore year for national robotics competition, ROBOCON Malaysia.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #FF7A59;"><b>ROBOCON Recuitment</b></h2>
  I was recruited as the university robotics club member during freshmen year. I started to learn about fundamentals of mechanisms, design theory, and robotics when making robots.
  I realized this was a good opportunity to practize what I've learnt from lecture. From the start, making robot from scratch without any knowledge was definitely difficult, and
  I have to thank my seniors for guiding me along the way.</p><br>
                             
                             
 <p> My first robot was a simple structure that allowed mounting of motors with wheels to execute line following using IR sensors<em>(Unfortunately, I lost all the photos)</em>.
 To prepare for the national competition, I learnt while making robots with seniors.

  Robots in each year aims to complete the tasks given using the shortest time. For this year, the robots were required to pick up the ball from rack and throw it through a ring to score points.
  Even though the throwing mechanism is not perfect, I thought we would have a chance to at least enter quarter finals. Unfortunately, one of the PCBs was short before competition and
  the robots did not perform accordingly.

  <p>The defeat from last competition did not stop us from participating in the next one. 
  Here I built the wheeled robot using Mecanum wheel with structures on top of the base to execute mechanisms. The pneumatic cylinders consumed air from the soda bottle to pick up object for throwing.</p><br>

  <p> And our team was awarded 2nd runner-up for the competition! It definitely was the effort from everyone to make this possible.

<h2 style="color: #FF7A59;"><b>Lessons Learnt and Possible Improvement</b></h2>
      <p>Although this robotics competition prioritizes hands-on to make functional robots, we should also consider the following techniques in making robots:
      <ul>
          <li>Utlization of ROS</li>
          <li>Path Planning</li>
          <li>Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
