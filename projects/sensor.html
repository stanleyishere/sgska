                            <p>This project is a collaborated work with mscLab,<a href="https://www.ums.edu.my/fkj/"> Faculty of Engineering UMS</a> and IOT Control Solutions Ltd., a start-up founded by my friend, 
                            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyiak-tien-tang-307b97134/">Nyiak Tien Tang</a>.<br>
                            I worked on this project at the last semester of undergrad. This project is to conduct electromyography when the MyoWare muscle sensor is attached on user's hand or leg.
                            The signals sent from the sensor(s) would be collected in a cloud storage system for further analysis.                          
                            Since it is not practical to directly attach the sensor onto skin surface, I was responsible to design and develop a casing that can mount the sensor inside.

                                The ESP32-WROOM-32 is soldered with the MyoWare muscle sensor for wireless signal transmission. This is a novel technology featured in this project
                                all the sensors can wireless transmit data to the cloud server easily and greatly improve the application of muscle strength assessment.

                            I firstly design the casing via SolidWorks where it is designed to be as compact as possible.

                            I fabricted the casing via FDM process with Creality Ender 3 V-2. Below shows the printed casing with sensor.
                            There are two straps provided to wear the sensor with electrodes snapped on the sensor's snap connectors.
