 <p>This project is a mandatory final year subject to partially fulfil the degree requirement. 
 My project supervisor was Ir. Dr.<a href="https://sites.google.com/ums.edu.my/greenmechpro/bihlii?authuser=0"> Chua Bih Lii</a>. Since I was actively invovled in making robots,
 I specifically chose quadruped robot as my project title to further enhance my knowledge and understanding of robotics. <p><br><br>
 
<h2 style="color: #FF7A59;"><b>Quadruped Robot</b></h2>    
The quadruped robot is a five-bar linkage leg with direct drive mechanism.

Since most commercialized robots (Spot, AnyMAL, Laikago) are expensive due to sophisticated hardware to meet performance, 
I intended to make a cost-effective robot that approximated at $1000.<br><br>

<p>At the first phase, I did mathematical analysis of the leg linkage which aimed to find the relationship of leg tip and actuator.<p>

<p>For leg linkage arrangement, I proposed two arrangments.<p>

<hr />
<p>In MATLAB, I tried to simulate the relationship between joint angles and leg tip coordinates using IK and also the joint coordinates during one step forward.<p>

<hr />

<p> I also did FEA on certain robot parts to verify the design feasibility and functionality since supposedly they outght to be manufactured.<p> In this project,
a universal bracket that could be mounted with motors and external encoders.                        
The initial thickness was not accepted and FOS < 1. Therefore, further modification was implemented to increase the bracket thickness.<p>

<hr />
<p> Nonethesless, due to severe pandemic situation in Kota Kinabalu, instead of fabricating the entire robot, 
I could only fabricate a single leg unit with the limited time I had in lab. Using 3D printing, I fabricated the leg joint to assemble all the linkages.<p>
