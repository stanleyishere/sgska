 This project is a mandatory final year subject to partially fulfil the degree requirement. 
 My project supervisor was Ir. Dr.<a href="https://sites.google.com/ums.edu.my/greenmechpro/bihlii?authuser=0"> Chua Bih Lii</a>. Since I was actively invovled in making robots,
 I specifically chose quadruped robot as my project title to further enhance my knowledge and understanding of robotics. <br><br>
 
 The quadruped robot is a five-bar linkage leg with direct drive mechanism.

Since most commercialized robots (Spot, AnyMAL, Laikago) are expensive due to sophisticated hardware to meet performance, 
I intended to make a cost-effective robot that approximated at $1000.<br><br>

At the first phase, I did mathematical analysis of the leg linkage which aimed to find the relationship of leg tip and actuator.

For leg linkage arrangement, I proposed two arrangments.

<hr />
In MATLAB, I tried to simulate the relationship between joint angles and leg tip coordinates using IK and also the joint coordinates during one step forward.

<hr />
I also did FEA on certain robot parts to verify the design feasibility and functionality since supposedly they outght to be manufactured.
