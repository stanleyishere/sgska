                I was hired to conduct a research work for 3D printing and responsible to publish a journal as to fulfill the research grant requirement.
                The project leader was again my undergraduate supervisor Ir. Dr.<a href="https://sites.google.com/ums.edu.my/greenmechpro/bihlii?authuser=0"> Chua Bih Lii</a>. 
                Since I just finished my undergraduate and am applying for postgraduate studies, this research work serves as a fundamental practice for me.<p><br><br>

                The research grant is a FRGS grant by Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia where the proposed title is 
                <i>"An Investigation on Feeder Mechanism and Extruder Nozzle Design of a Fused Deposition Modelling Process"</i>.
                The main goal of this research project is to increase the deposition rate of FDM process and determine the optimal deposition rate of filament while maintaning a desirable quality of surface finishing.
                Through this project, the control of deposition rate can be then adjusted to cater the different needs and requirements of the FDM application along with adaptive slicing.

            <div><p>
                The deposition rate is the unit cube of filament deposited over time, which can be defined as the product of extrusion multiplier,
                line width, layer height, and feed rate of the machine. Feed rate here refers to the multiplier of movement speed of all machine axes (X,Y,Z,F).
                Therefore, for the first part of research, we vary the extrusion multiplier and feed rate of the machine to produce different specimens (Using 0.5mm nozzle and layer height 0.2mm).<br>
                To visualise the difference affected by the said parameters, the specimen printed is a single-layer rectangular block of 60mm length and 20mm width as shown in figure below.
