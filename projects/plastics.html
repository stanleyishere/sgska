  <p>This project is a integrated design subject in junior year where my friends and I were assigned to design a plastic extrusion system. 
  The plastic extrusion system should be able to melt high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and extrude it to be plastic filament.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #FF7A59;"><b>Plastic Extrusion System CAD</b></h2>
  <p>I was reponsible of modelling the system in CAD where the system utilizes screw rotation to create compression inside the barrel. 
      The barrel was attached with three heat bands to heat the HDPE flakes inside.</p><br>

  <p>To set the proper melting temperature of HDPE flakes, which spans between 130.8&#8451; to 390&#8451;(Abeykoon et al., 2014), FEM is used to calculate the required temperatureof heat band.
      The temperature is found out to be 220&#8451;. Below shows the cross-section of extrusion system. </p>

  <hr   /> 
  <p>Besides, since the barrel length should not exceed 300mm as large L/D ratio limits the performance, we also simulated the optimal number of heat bands to be used in the system.
  After thermal simulation and data plotting, four heat bands undeniably provides greatest heat to the system with lowest preheat time of 275s but the plastic almost apporaches degradation temperature, and thus, 
  three heat bands are used. </p><br>
  
  <p>With three heat bands, the plastic temperature along the barrel is plotted using simulation. Placing the first heat band and third heat band nearer to the second heat band
      helps to increase the temperature and ease the melt flim to flow out more easily.</p>

  <p>We also tried to plot the time history graph of plastic temperature when the heat bands are switched off and on using a thermostat.
      Below shows that time is needed to stablize the heating process so the HDPE melt film is maintained in consistent quality. </p>

  <p>However, due to <a href="https://news.google.com/covid19/map?hl=en-MY&mid=%2Fm%2F07348&gl=MY&ceid=MY%3Aen">severe pandemic situation</a> in Sabah, the semester was halted and converted to online learning.
      Therefore, our plan to fabricate the system and implement further testing was impossible.
   
  <hr   />
  <h2 style="color: #FF7A59;"><b>Possible Improvement</b></h2>
  <p>That being said, we should also study the effect of HDPE flake size to the heat band temperature and preheat tinme which has not been covered in the project.
      Besides, the flow rate of HDPE flakes into the system is also not considered.
